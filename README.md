**The ERP system for remote companies will streamline HR, Finance, and Employee management by incorporating features such as employee onboarding, attendance tracking with real-time check-in/check-out, leave management, self and team lead appraisals, payroll processing, expense tracking, and comprehensive financial reporting. The system will be developed using *React* for building an intuitive and interactive frontend, while *Supabase* will handle backend operations, including data management with PostgreSQL, real-time updates for attendance and appraisals, secure authentication, and file storage. The app will be deployed on *Vercel* or *Netlify*, ensuring seamless scalability, continuous integration, and robust hosting.**
